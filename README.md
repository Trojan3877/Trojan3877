💻 Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer | Software Engineer | Cloud AI/ML | AI Ethics Advocate

I am an undergraduate student pursuing a B.S. in Artificial Intelligence & Advancing Computer Science (UAT), concurrently completing an A.S. in Engineering Technology (Machine Learning specialization). My passion is building production-grade AI/ML systems that drive real-world business impact — with a focus on cloud-native, scalable, and ethical AI.

My public GitHub portfolio (github.com/Trojan3877) demonstrates advanced AI/ML, Data Engineering, System Design, and C++/Python projects, including:

✅ AWS SageMaker + Snowflake ML Pipeline: Financial Fraud Detection
✅ AI-Vehicle Safety Classifier (C++ + Python)
✅ NYC Finance Data Engineering Project
✅ SafeSight-AI (Computer Vision for Healthcare/Assistive Tech)
✅ AI-Powered Business Application Lab
✅ TrojanChat App (System Design + Fullstack)

Currently completing the Interview Kickstart ML Engineering Bootcamp, and planning to pursue a Master’s in AI after graduation.
I am targeting AI/ML Engineering internships, AI residencies, and Big Tech/FinTech Software Engineering roles.

🎓 Senior Undergraduate | Software Development (Web & Mobile Applications)
🤖 AI / ML Engineering Focus | Backend & Platform Systems
📍 Cleveland, Ohio

I’m a senior undergraduate software developer focused on building real, end-to-end systems, not just class assignments. My work blends software engineering fundamentals with applied AI/ML, emphasizing clean architecture, scalability, and production-ready code.

I actively build projects using Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Docker, FastAPI, SQL, and CI/CD, with hands-on experience across machine learning pipelines, recommendation systems, backend APIs, and data-driven applications.

🧠 What I’m Working On

AI & Machine Learning projects (training, evaluation, deployment-ready structure)

Backend services and APIs for ML-powered applications

Recommendation systems and data pipelines

Clean, testable, well-documented codebases

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python, SQL
ML / AI: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face
Backend: FastAPI, REST APIs
DevOps: Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
Data: Pandas, NumPy
Systems: Linux, Git, Cloud fundamentals

🎯 Career Focus

I’m actively seeking Software Engineering Intern, AI / Machine Learning Engineering Intern, or Platform / Backend Intern roles.

I’ve been referred to Microsoft Explore through professional networking and am preparing for a Master’s in AI Engineering (UPenn). My goal is to gain hands-on industry experience while continuing to build impactful systems.

📂 Featured Projects

🔹 DeepSequence Recommender – Sequence-based recommendation system
🔹 AI / ML Pipelines – Data → Training → Evaluation workflows
🔹 Backend APIs – ML-backed services with clean architecture

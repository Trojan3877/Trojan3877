🔗 Visit my GitHub: [Trojan3877](https://github.com/Trojan3877)

---

👉 Next steps:  
- Create the special repo: `Trojan3877/Trojan3877` and add this as `README.md`.  
- Replace placeholders (`your-linkedin`, repo names/links if slightly different).  
- This instantly makes your GitHub profile look like a **curated portfolio site**.

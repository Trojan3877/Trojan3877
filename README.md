# Hi, I’m Corey 👋  

🎯 **Aspiring AI/ML Engineer** | Dual B.S. in Artificial Intelligence + Computer Science | Future UC Berkeley MSSE & Ph.D.  

🚀 I build **AI systems that blend research with real-world impact**. My GitHub is my portfolio of Computer Vision, NLP/LLM, and MLOps projects — all with reproducible metrics, APIs, and deployment scaffolding.

👉 Next steps:  
- Create the special repo: `Trojan3877/Trojan3877` and add this as `README.md`.  
- Replace placeholders (`your-linkedin`, repo names/links if slightly different).  
- This instantly makes your GitHub profile look like a **curated portfolio site**.

⚡ Question for you: do you want me to now generate the **individual README upgrades** for each repo (FER, Quant LLM, AWS Pipeline, ER Triage) one by one — each with Results tables, Quickstart blocks, and sample visuals baked in?
